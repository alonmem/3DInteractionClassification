# Problem definition
<b>Problem:</b>Given 4 videos from 4 different cameras, Detect type of interaction.
4 types of interaction
- No interaction
- Touch
- Look
- Both

<b>Challenge:</b> The system cannot assume anything about the scene <br/>

# Input
<p align="center"><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/eXVyw8/Screen_Shot_2018_07_24_at_11_42_42.png" width="50%"></p>
We receive as input 4 video cameras that are in the corner of the room. 

# First approach - 3D reconstruction

We first calibrate our 4 cameras in-order to reconstructe the 3d scene.

<b>Then, we perform the following steps:</b>
1. Detect person using openpose
2. Recognize person's identity
3. find (x,y) coordinates of both eyes and noise
4. Find (x,y,z) coordinates from two cameras
5. Find each personâ€™s face plane
6. Get plane's normal => looking direction
7. Classify interaction

This approach worked well but had room for improvment. This is because of errors in the calibration. 
Because of this issues we improved to our second approach.
